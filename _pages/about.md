Curious in exploring things around and within. 

I am currently a postgraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Delhi](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/). 
I work with the [SRISHTI](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/research.html) research group on intelligent systems for PCB CAD under [Prof. Smruti R. Sarangi](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/index.html). 

Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer at [LG Soft India](https://www.lgsoftindia.com/aboutus.php) and earned my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Dharwad](https://ee.iitdh.ac.in/).

Beyond work, I enjoy exploring [Carnatic music](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLoTEz-5MNSm9dDwL-a_m9PsO8N3fKeRI&feature=shared), Tamil classics, and crime fiction. 

This website is a space to share my thoughts on technology, life, and the places, people, and food I encounter.
